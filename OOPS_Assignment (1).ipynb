        "      for creating objects.     It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from the class will have.           Essentially, a class specifies:\n",

        "  - \tIn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a  \n",

        "    - Abstraction:-\n",
        "      Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionalities to the user. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Encapsulation:-\n",
        "        Encapsulation is the technique of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class) while restricting access to some components of the object to maintain control and security.\n",

        "    - \tInheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental\n",
        "        concept where one class (called the child class or subclass) can acquire the properties and methods of another class (called the parent class or superclass). It allows for code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.\n",

        "        Programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods to protect them from unwanted interference and misuse.

        "\n",
        "        A static method is a method that belongs to the class but does not have access to the class (cls) or instance (self). It behaves like a regular function but is defined inside the class for organizational purposes.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - \tMethod overloading is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "        where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters. In Python, true method overloading is not directly supported because Python does not allow multiple methods with the same name within a class.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - \tMethod overriding is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "        where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

        "\n",
        "    - \tIn Python, the @property decorator is used to define a method that  behaves like an attribute of a class. It allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, but internally, you can add logic to get, set, or delete values. This is especially useful when you want to control access to an attribute and provide a way to customize how it is read or modified, while keeping the external interface clean and simple.\n",

        "15.\tWhat is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - \tAn abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated      directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, but they may also contain some implementation. The primary purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - \tObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that  organizes code into \"objects\"â€”self-contained units that bundle data and the methods that operate on that data. OOP promotes concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, which offer numerous advantages over other programming paradigms, such as procedural programming.\n",

        "    -\t Each instance has its own copy of the instance variables, and changes made to an instance variable affect only that instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - \tMultiple inheritance in Python refers to a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.
